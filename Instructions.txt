Your goal is trying to make the enemy's hitpoints zero before your hitpoints gets zero.
Every time your balls hit an obstacle, both an obstacle hitpoint and enemy's hitpoints decreases by one. Every time obstacles reach the bottom, your hit
point deceases by the remaining hitpoints of the obstacles. Every time an obstacle disappear either by getting hitpoint zero or reaching the bottom,
a new obstacle is created,and there are constantly five obstacles falling. Also there is 12% chance that new obstacle becomes blue. If your balls hit
a blue obstacle, your hitpoint increases by one, but no damage to the enemy, and if it reaches the bottom, you will be
damaged as in the case of other red obstacles.
